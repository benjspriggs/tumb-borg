// Sonnet XLII

That thou hast her it is not all my grief,
     And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;
That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,
     A loss in love that touches me more nearly.
     Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye:
     Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her;
     And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
     Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.
     If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
     And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;
Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
     And both for my sake lay on me this cross:
     But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;
     Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.

// 'I am Wind, you are Fire'
O you who've gone on pilgrimage -
              where are you, where, oh where?
Here, here is the Beloved!
              Oh come now, come, oh come!
Your friend, he is your neighbor,
             he is next to your wall -
You, erring in the desert -
              what air of love is this?
If you'd see the Beloved's
              form without any form -
You are the house, the master,
              You are the Kaaba, you! . . .
Where is a bunch of roses,
              if you would be this garden?
Where, one soul's pearly essence
              when you're the Sea of God?
That's true - and yet your troubles
              may turn to treasures rich -
How sad that you yourself veil
              the treasure that is yours!
